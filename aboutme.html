<p>My name is Jackie Ortiz. I was born on June 21, 2000 in Berkeley, California. Both of my parents are from a small rancho in Mexico. I am the youngest of four silblings. I grew up surrounded by my extended family and from their diverse personalities have partially shaped me into the person I am today. I will be a senior in the fall at Middle College High School; Class of 2018. Once I graduate, I want to major in Business and minor in Computer Science. Throughout my career I want to dedicate much of time towards addressing two issues: connectivity and accessibility.</p>
